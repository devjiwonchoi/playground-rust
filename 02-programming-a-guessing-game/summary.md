# Rust Syntax

- start..=end means range from start to end
- `let` is used to declare a constant variable
- `let mut` is used to declare a mutable variable
- `::` is an associated function to a type on the left, not confident with it for now
- `&` is a reference, immutable by default, no need to copy data into memory multiple times, not confident with it for now
- `.expect()` catches `Err` from `Result`, I would say it's like `.catch` in JS
- So Rust allows shadowing declaration that is independent, not overwriting like `var` in JS, what??
- template literals are simply "{}"
- pass directly the variable or after with comma like ("{}", var)
